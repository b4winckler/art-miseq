# Input format

MiSeq raw data consists of two fastq files - one for the forward reads and one
for the reverse reads.  The reads in these two files should be in the same
order.  The forward reads consist of 301 bp from the coding strand and the
reverse reads consists of 301 bp from the noncoding strand.  Both reads are in
the 5' to 3' direction which means that the reverse reads must be reverse
complemented before they can be merged with the forward reads.

An example fastq header looks like this:

    @HWI-M01548R:6:000000000-A8JPR:1:1101:18848:1551 1:N:0:TCCTGAGCTATCCTCT

The headers from a forward and reverse read should be identical apart from the
string after the space which starts with `1:` for a forward read and `2:` for a
reverse read.  The 16 bp at the end are the *sample barcode* which is used to
identify which sample the read belongs to.  The barcode is broken down into two
*indexes* of 8 bp each.  In this example index1 is `TATCCTCT` (the last 8 bp),
and index2 is `TCCTGAGC` (the first 8 bp in reverse complement).

Every forward read begins with a 16 bp *bin identifier*, followed by 0-2 bp of
phasing nucleotides (to be ignored), followed by the forward primer 340F.  Each
reverse read (before reverse complementing) begins with 1-3 phasing nucleotides
(`A`, `CA` or `GCA`) followed by the reverse primer 806R (in reverse
complement).

 Primer     Sequence
-------     ---------
340F        `TCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGT`
806R        `ATTAGATACCCTGGTAGTCC`

Here is an example of the start of a forward read (with bin identifier
`CCAACCTTCTATGGCG`, followed by 1 phasing nucleotide, 340F, and then the
sequence `AGGGAAT`):

    CCAACCTTCTATGGCGATCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAGTAGGGAAT

And here is an example of the start of a reverse read (with phase `CA`,
followed by 806R in reverse complement, and then the sequence `CCTGTTTGCT`):

    CAGGACTACCAGGGTATCTAATCCTGTTTGCT
